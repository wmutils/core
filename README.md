wmutils' core
=============

wmutils' core is a set of tools for X windows manipulation. Each tool only has
one purpose, to make it as flexible and reliable as possible.

Here's a quick example. This snippet will put the currently focused window in
the middle of the screen:

    #!/bin/sh

    # get current window id, width and height
    WID=$(pfw)
    WW=$(wattr w $WID)
    WH=$(wattr h $WID)

    # get screen width and height
    ROOT=$(lsw -r)
    SW=$(wattr w $ROOT)
    SH=$(wattr h $ROOT)

    # move the current window to the center of the screen
    wtp $(((SW - WW)/2)) $(((SH - WH)/2)) $WW $WH $WID

daemon which allow binding applications to hot keys.
